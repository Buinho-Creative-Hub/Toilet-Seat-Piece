## Problem

Buinho FabLab's bathrom's toilet seat was loose due to loose nuts and oxidation.


## Solution

In order to fix the toilet seat and prevent it from getting out of place when used, the rusty nuts needed to be removed, cleaned, and reinstalled, broken pieces needed to be replaced by new ones, and the rust from the screws cleaned.

Both pieces that guide the toiled seat screw through the toiled body broke and new ones needed to be fabricated.

To accomplish this, 3D printing was the fabrication methodology chosen to create the replicas.

This repo contains the digital files for the broken pieces replacements.
